<h1>Water Level Control</h1>
<h6>COAL ESP - 3rd Semester</h6>

<h4>Brief Intro</h4>
<p>The goal of this project is to use assembly language to program a piece of hardware. I used Atmel AVR instruction set, a machine language for Atmel microcontroller, to program an Arduino Uno having ATMega328P microcontroller to indicate different levels of water in a water tank with the help of an ultra-sonic sensor. The sensor, HC-SR04, which used ultra sonic waves to measure its distance from an obstacle, was used to measure the depth of the water surface and based on the different levels, a set of 3 LEDs: Red, Green and Blue were used to indicate depleted water level, normal water level and full water level respectively.</p>
