<h1>Water Level Control</h1>
<h6>COAL ESP - 3rd Semester</h6>

<h4>Breif Intro</h4>
<p>Atmel AVR instruction set is used to code Arduino Uno, containing ATMega328P microcontroller, along with Ultra Sonic sensor, HC-SR04, to detect different depths of water level in a water tank or reservoir. The depth is represented via a set of 3 LEDs, Red LED will turn on when the water is almost depleted, the Green LED will turn on when the tank is almost full and the Blue LED will turn on when the water level is in between. The Ultrasonic Sensor is used to find the depth of the water by measuring the distance of the water surface from the top of the tank where the sensor is connected.</p>
